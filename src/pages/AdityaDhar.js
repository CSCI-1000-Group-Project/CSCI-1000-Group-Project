Hi, my name is Aditya and I am from Boulder, and I currently a freshman studying computer science. My programming language of choice is Java, as I have worked with it in the past, however I am eager to learn more languages throughout my college career. I have also been looking into different fields of computer science that interest me, and so far I have interest in cybersecurity, however I am still exploring all of my options.
